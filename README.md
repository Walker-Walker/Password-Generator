#Password Generator Starter Code

##Functionality 

*Refactored code to utilize Arrays, math.random () , empty string, if conditional statements, for loop , user validation, and .push
*Script is utilzed to create a randomized password based on at least one user chosen content from the following choices, Number, Special Character, Uppercase letter, and Lowercase letters. 
*Password length must be at least 8 characters and at most 128.
*if conditional statements are used to provide validation for user choice parameters.
*arrays were set up to contain all characters and digits
*math.random and math.floor were used to choose a random array/s and character inside respective array/s 
*then pushed randomly chosen array/s into an empty array container 
*used math.random, math.floor to find a random array/s , and random element inside of respective array/s
*then used a for loop the length of the password. 
*set password equal to the += nElement of each iteration of the loop so the password would accrue values until the desired length was reached and the loop would end. 
*password variable was set to an empty string outside of the loop as to store the value from the loop thereby printing the password.
